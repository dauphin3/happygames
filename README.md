# Escape Room

This is an example Holochain game application that is meant to serve as a template for other Happ devs. The goal is to escape the room by making decisions that have outcomes, right now the results are random, but the idea is that you can take it and make the functionality work however makes sense (ie could be used for learning to solve problems/team work etc or just for silly fun to test your knowledge). Players can find clues that could accumulate for points, as well as 'wins' by succsessfully completing the room quests "escaping". It is designed to store player profiles and stats hosted on a P2P database (DHT) which could be used to keep track of leaderboards and other features. The intention is to build useful libraries for developing Holochain apps and encourage contributions toÂ https://github.com/holochain-open-dev

In the future other types of games and various helpful zomes can be added to expand this into a large Happ ecosystem with a variety of DNA
